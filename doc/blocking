Content blocking in Fifth
=========================

Fifth supports two types of content blocking, blacklisting and
whitelisting. Both may be used at the same time. The blacklist may be
used for things like conventional ad blocking, and the whitelist for
kiosk-type scenarios where only certain sites are allowed, for example.

The file names are "blacklist" and "whitelist", present in your profile
directory (~/.fifth in a system install).

The environment variable FIFTH_DEBUG_BLOCKING, if set, prints out
any blocked resources to stderr.

File format
-----------

The format for both files is one pattern per line. A pattern may be a
direct string, or it may contain * wildcards. No comments or empty lines
are allowed.

For example, these lines would block a specific image, and a certain
annoying site:

----
http://foo.com/dir/image.jpg
http*facebook.*
http*//*fbcdn.*/*
----

Conversion from Opera
---------------------

The format used by Opera is close, containing only some header comments
and a white/blacklist boolean that need to be stripped out.
